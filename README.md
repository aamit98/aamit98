Amit Asher 👋

Software Engineering · Backend / Systems / DevOps
Ben-Gurion University (Year 4)

I design and build reliable backend systems with a strong focus on clean architecture, data modeling, concurrency, and production-grade services.
I enjoy working close to the OS, debugging race conditions, and turning vague specs into stable APIs.
