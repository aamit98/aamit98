## Amit Asher 👋
Software Engineering  
Backend - Data - Systems

Ben-Gurion University (Year 4)

I build backend systems with a focus on data correctness, clean APIs, and predictable behavior.  
I enjoy working close to the system, modeling real domains, and turning vague requirements into services teams can rely on.

## Technical Focus

Languages - Java - Python - JavaScript - C - C++

Backend - Spring Boot - Node.js - Express - REST APIs - JWT authentication - WebSockets

Data & Storage - PostgreSQL - SQLite - MongoDB - Schema design - Transactions - Data consistency

Infra / DevOps - Docker - Docker Compose - Linux - Git - Basic CI/CD

I care about readable code, clear ownership, and systems that behave the same in production as they do locally.
