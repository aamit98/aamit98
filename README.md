Ben-Gurion University (Year 4)

I build backend systems with a focus on data correctness, clean APIs, and predictable behavior.
I enjoy working close to the system, modeling real domains, and turning vague requirements into services teams can rely on.

Open to 50%+ student roles
Backend • Data • Infra
Israel | Hybrid | Tel-Aviv area

Technical Focus

Languages
Java · Python · JavaScript · C · C++

Backend
Spring Boot · Node.js · Express
REST APIs · JWT authentication · WebSockets

Data & Storage
PostgreSQL · SQLite · MongoDB
Schema design · Transactions · Data consistency

Infra / DevOps
Docker · Docker Compose · Linux · Git
Basic CI/CD

I care about readable code, clear ownership, and systems that behave the same in prod as they do locally.

Projects
🎥 ReelHub

Video Sharing Platform

https://github.com/aamit98/Reelhub

A mobile-first video sharing system built end-to-end.

Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
Client: React Native (Expo)

What matters

Video and thumbnail upload pipeline

Feed and metadata APIs

Mobile playback and UI state handling

Practical lessons in media storage, URLs, and streaming behavior

🎓 StudyBuddy

Collaborative Learning Platform

https://github.com/aamit98/StuddyBuddy

A large-scale university project designed as a production-style system, not a demo.

Stack
Backend: Spring Boot, REST, JWT
Frontend: React
Mobile: React Native
Database: PostgreSQL

Backend & data focus

Domain modeling (users, courses, groups)

Authentication and authorization flows

Real-time chat and file sharing

Designed for scalability and high load

Includes a full requirements and architecture document.

🍽️ BistroFlow

Restaurant Management System

https://github.com/aamit98/bistroflow

A real business-style backend with multiple operational domains.

Stack
Backend: Java, Spring Boot 4, JWT
Frontend: React
Database: SQLite / PostgreSQL

Key areas

Staff scheduling and HR flows

Inventory and supplier management

Notifications and analytics

☁️ Mini-Dropbox

File Storage System

https://github.com/aamit98/mini-dropbox

A simplified Dropbox-style system focused on backend separation of concerns.

Stack
Backend: Java, Spring Boot
Protocols: TFTP-style file transfer + REST
Storage: Persistent local storage

Highlights

File upload/download lifecycle

Authorization-aware access

Clear separation between control plane (API) and data plane (file transfer)

What I’m Looking For

Backend / Data / Infra student roles where I can:

Own backend components end-to-end

Work with real data and real constraints

Learn from strong code reviews and production systems
